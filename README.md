# Crossword Puzzle 

As I was at my grandmother's house I saw the crossword puzzle below:

Instead of being given hints of what the word is, you're given the letters that are in the word. Each of these letters are numbered 1 - 26. The aim of the crossword is to find the letter for each of these numbers. 

To begin with you're given 4 of the letters as a hint.

This looked like a crossword puzzle that could be perfect for a computer to solve!
